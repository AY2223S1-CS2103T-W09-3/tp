#LinkedOn
* This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * As an employee, you will be able to easily view which members are in your team
  * As an employer, you can edit the team information and team members in the team
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application used for managing teams in a work place.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `LinkedOn` because it let's an employer or employee easily connect with their colleagues and view their work place tasks.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[LinkedOn Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w09-3.github.io/tp/)**.
