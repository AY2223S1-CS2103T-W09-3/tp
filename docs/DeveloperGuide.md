### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` `TeamListPanel`, `TaskListPanel` , `DisplayUserWindow` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Team` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data. This address book data consists of:
  * all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object),
  * all `Team` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTeamList` object),
  * and all 'Task' objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTaskList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person`, `Team`, and `Task` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>`, `ObservableList<Team>`, and `ObservableList<Task>` respectively, that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Add Task Feature

#### Implementation

The add task feature adds a task into a team and this change is reflected in the Graphical User Interface.
The user may specify a deadline to be associated with the task (i.e. deadline is optional).
The deadline is implemented using `Optional<LocalDate>`. Thus, the deadline can be passed into other methods without knowing whether the deadline exists or not. The `Task` objects are stored in a `UniqueTaskList`.

Given below is an example usage scenario.

Step 1. The user creates the task using the `taskadd` command, executing `taskadd t/1 n/Create Feature A d/12-12-2022` to add the task "Create Feature A" to team 1, with 12th December 2022 as the deadline.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add task operation works:
![TaskAddSequenceDiagram](images/TaskAddSequenceDiagram.png)

### Mark Task Feature

#### Implementation

The mark task feature marks a task as completed and this change is reflected in the Graphical User Interface.

Given below is an example usage scenario

Step 1. The user creates the tasks and assign it to a team using the `taskadd` command. The new task created will be initialized with the property isDone to be false.

Step 2. After the task is completed, the user want to mark the task as done. The user then executes `taskmark t/1 task/3` to mark the 3rd task in the 1st team as completed. The task which is contained in team 1 would be marked as completed and this would be reflected in the gui.

Step 3. The user realised that there is some error in the task and wants to unmark it. The user then executes `taskummark t/1 task/3` to unmark the 3rd task in the 1st team.


The following sequence diagram shows how the mark task operation works:
![TaskMarkSequenceDiagram](images/TaskMarkSequenceDiagram.png)

### Edit Task Feature

#### Implementation

The edit task feature updates the name of the task to the new name given by the user and this change is reflected in the Graphical User Interface.

Given below is an example usage scenario:

Step 1. The user creates the task and assign it to a team using `taskadd` command. The name of the task provided by the user is stored as Name in the Task class.

Step 2. The user might want to update the name of the task in the future. The user then executes `taskedit t/1 task/1 n/update GUI` to update the name of the task from the previous name to the new name provided by the user. The `taskedit` command will call `Model#getFilteredTeamList()`, which then gets the specified task from the `UniqueTaskList`. The specified task in team 1 would be updated to the new name by keeping all the other task feature as same. `Model#updateFilterPersonList` is called to update the team with the new task name and this would be reflected in the gui.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit task operation works:
![TaskEditSequenceDiagram](images/TaskEditSequenceDiagram.png)

### Delete Task Feature

#### Implementation

The delete task feature deletes the task from the specified team given by the user and this change is reflected in the Graphical User Interface.

Given below is an example usage scenario:

Step 1. The user creates the task and assign it to a team using `taskadd` command. The tasks are stored in the UniqueTaskList for each Team. 

Step 2. The user might want to delete the task to remove the unwanted task in the future. The user then executes `taskdelete t/1 task/1` to delete the task from the specified team. The `taskdelete` command will call `Model#getFilteredTeamList()`, which then gets the specified task from the `UniqueTaskList`. The specified task in team 1 would be deleted from the taskList. `Model#updateFilterPersonList` is called to update the team with the new deletions and this would be reflected in the gui.

The following sequence diagram shows how delete task operation works:
![TaskDeleteSequenceDiagram](images/TaskDeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

### Edit Person Feature

#### Implementation

The edit person feature edits the information of a person in the address book, this change is reflected within
all teams containing the edited person. The editable information are phone number, email address, physical
address and tag.

Given below is an example usage scenario

Step 1. The user wants to change the phone number of a person to 80779043. Said person is indexed number 4 in
the global list. The user executes `edit 1 p/80779043`.

Step 2. The parser will create a `edit` command. This `edit command` will call `Model#getFilteredList()`
to get the `person` specified by the index in the command then create a new `person` with the modified info.
`Model#updateFiltedPersonList` is called to update all teams with the edited members.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit task operation works:
![EditPersonSequenceDiagram](images/EditPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

### Create Team Feature

#### Implementation

The Create Team Feature allows the user to create a team in EZLead. Team will be stored in a global team list

Step 1. The user wants to create a team named Backend. The user executes `create t/backend`.

Step 2. The parser will create a team object and a `createTeam` command containing created team.
The `createTeam` command will call `Model#addTeam` to add the team into EZLead.

The following sequence diagram show how the create team operation works:
![CreateTeamSequenceDiagram](images/CreateTeamSequenceDiagram.png)

### Delete Team Feature

#### Implementation

The Delete Team Feature allows the user to delete a team in EZLead. After deletion, the team will no longer be reflected in the Graphical User Interface.

Given below is an example usage scenario

Step 1. The user created a team using the `createteam` command.

Step 2. The user assigns some members into the newly created team using the `assign` command.

Step 3. The user realises that the team has completed their work and is no longer needed, and proceeds to delete the team using the `deleteteam t/1` command (Given that the team created in Step 1 is the team in index 1).

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete team operation works:
![DeleteTeamSequenceDaigram](images/DeleteTeamSequenceDiagram.png)

### Edit Team Feature

#### Implementation

The Edit Team Feature allows the user to edit the name of a pre-existing team in EZLead.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Edit Team mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `editteam t/1 n/Team1` to change the name of first team to Team1.

Step 2. The `editTeam` command is created by the parser using the given team index and new name. It calls
`Model#setTeamName`to change the name of the required team.

### Assign Member Feature

#### Implementation

The Assign Member Feature allows the user to assign a person to a pre-existing team in EZLead.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Assign Member mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `assign m/1 t/1` to assign the first person as a member in the first team.

Step 2. The `assignMember` command is created by the parser using the given member's index (global person index) and 
team's index. It calls `Model#addPersonToTeam` to add the person to given team.

### unAssign Member Feature

#### Implementation

The unAssign Member Feature allows the user to assign a person to a pre-existing team in EZLead.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the unAssign Member mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `unassign m/1 (global person index) t/1` to unAssign the first person as a member from the first team.

Step 2. The `unassignMember` command is created by the parser using the given member's index (global person index) and 
team's index. It calls `Model#removePersonFromTeam` to remove the person from given team.
